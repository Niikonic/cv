        <p>
          I am not just an <em>artist</em> but rather a vessel.<br />
          Previously when asked to describe the type of art I create, I'd often times draw a blank.<br />
          I know now I am a <strong>Storyteller</strong>, an orator; charged with the task of depicting the times. </p>
        <p>As
          <!-- this should be a link to Nina Simones bio https://www.ninasimone.com/biography/--> <a href="https://www.ninasimone.com/biography/">Nina Simone</a> so candidly said
          "An artist's duty, as far as I'm concerned, is to reflect the times."
          In all mediums of my artistic expression there is inlaid, a message.
          I truly enjoy creation as well as studying and mimicking styles, while respecting those that came before me in order to tell new stories that may be passed down through the generations to come, in a language communicable by all.
        </p>
<p> <strong>THAT IS ART</strong>.</p>
